    <h1>3 Treasured Things In My Life</h1>

    <p>
      Today I will go over the 5 most treasured things in my life and why they
      matter to me.
    </p>

    <h2 class="center">My Family and Friends</h2>
    <p class="center">

        width="500"

      An image of me with my family.
      <img
        src="img/FriendsImage.jpg"
        alt="An image of me with my friends"
        width="500"
      />
      An image of me with my friend's family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humans are social by nature. A life without family and friends is
      unimaginable. Your family and friends define who you are to an extent and
      you grow alongside them.

    <h2 class="center">Chess</h2>

      width="500"
    />
    <p>Chess is my favourite board game because it:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Involves Strategy</li>
      <li>Is fun to play</li>
      <li>Has value in modern society</li>
      <li>Relates to history</li>
      <li>And is the first board game that I was introduced to</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Chess requires no luck, and it is the best example of a game that is "easy
      to learn, hard to master." This means you need to put real effort into
      learning the game. You can't just keep playing and hope to get lucky.
    </p>

    <h2 class="center">Food</h2>
    <p>
      Food is a neccassaity in life. It fuels our everyday activities, and gives
      us the nutrition we require to survive. Food can also provide comfort or
      evoke emotional responses due to our memories or current condition. Food
      can also be considered scrumptious depending on who you ask.

    <h2 class="center">Closing remarks</h2>
    <p>
      Those are the most important things about me that you should know. If you
      want to share your favourite things, you should know that I do not have
      social media. Sorry.
